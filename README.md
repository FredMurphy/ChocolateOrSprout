# Chocolate or Sprout
This is the source code for a project entered into Element 14's [Holiday Special 2023 competition](https://community.element14.com/challenges-projects/project14/holiday-special-2023/).

This is a Python project - because my 10 year old son is learning Python. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with the [BuildHat](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/build-hat/) controlling a 2 colour sensors and 3 motors from some now retired [Lego Boost](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/boost-creative-toolbox-17101?age-gate=grown_up) sets.
